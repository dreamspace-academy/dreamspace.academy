                <p>DreamSpace Academy organized the Teaching Technology and Design workshop with Carrie Leung and
                    Benjamin James Simpson from STEAMHEAD from April 10th to 14th, 2023. </p>

                <b style="color: #56509F">Workshop Info</b>
                <p>The workshop focused on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Critical Thinking into
                    Teaching Protocols, with the aim of fostering progressive education and student-centered classrooms.
                    Participants were introduced to a variety of innovative teaching protocols, including the Reflection
                    Prompts, Gallery Walk Feedback, Menti Meter Crowdsourcing, and several other essential protocols.
                    These protocols were designed to enhance student motivation, empower students to take an active role
                    in their learning, create memorable educational experiences, and enable intentional teaching and
                    curriculum design During the workshop, the participant not only learned these teaching protocols but
                    also showcased their practical application and proposed ways to incorporate these protocols into
                    their existing curriculum and classroom settings.
                </p>

                <b style="color: #56509F">Impact</b>
                <p>Our workshops have created a significant ripple effect in the local education community. During the
                    training, teachers from Batticaloa schools and trainers from DreamSpace Academy received specialized
                    instruction. Following the workshop, DreamSpace Academy trainers began leading interactive workshops
                    for students and conducting Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions for school teachers.
                    <br><br>
                    This initiative has successfully reached more than 20 schools, fostering a collaborative learning
                    environment and enhancing teaching practices. Due to the positive outcomes, teachers, schools, and
                    the zonal education department have requested us to continue delivering TOT sessions across more
                    institutions. Our trainers are actively providing ongoing workshops for teachers
