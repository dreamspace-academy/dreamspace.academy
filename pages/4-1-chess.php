						It is widely accepted by most historians that the game of chess originated in India in the fifth or sixth century AD.
					</p>
					<p class="template-margin-top-3">
						The earliest known form of chess is two-handed chaturanga, Sanskrit for “the four branches of the army.” Like real Indian armies at that time, the pieces were called elephants, chariots, horses, and foot soldiers. Unlike modern chess, chaturanga was mainly a game of chance; results depended on how well you rolled the dice.
					</p>
					<p class="template-margin-top-3">
						From India, chaturanga spread quickly to Persia, where it was called chatrang. When Arabs invaded Persia in the seventh century, they called it shatranj and popularized it throughout the Arab world. Chess made its way to Europe in the tenth century as a result of the Arab expansion.
