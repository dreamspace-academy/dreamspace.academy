                                <p>Dr Nico Meißner is Senior Lecturer and Deputy Director (Learning & Teaching) at
                                    Griffith Film School, Australia’s largest film school. He is researching and writing
                                    on entrepreneurship in the creative industries and the intricate relations between
                                    storytelling and innovation. He was the inaugural Dean of the Faculty of Cinematic
                                    Arts in Malaysia and has taught documentary filmmaking, storytelling and
                                    entrepreneurship in the UK, Finland, Portugal, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Ghana,

                                <b style="color: #56509F">Workshop Info</b>
                                <p>The workshop focused on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Critical
                                    Thinking into Teaching Protocols, with the aim of fostering progressive education
                                    and student-centered classrooms. Participants were introduced to a variety of
                                    innovative teaching protocols, including the Reflection Prompts, Gallery Walk
                                    Feedback, Menti Meter Crowdsourcing, and several other essential protocols. These
                                    protocols were designed to enhance student motivation, empower students to take an
                                    active role in their learning, create memorable educational experiences, and enable
                                    intentional teaching and curriculum design. During the workshop, the participant not
                                    only learned these teaching protocols but also showcased their practical application
                                    and proposed ways to incorporate these protocols into their existing curriculum and
                                    classroom settings.</p>

                                <b style="color: #56509F">Impact</b>
                                <p>During the StoryLab workshop, we worked with 20 young people from Batticaloa,
                                    building techniques and the confidence to tell authentic stories. The StoryMapping
                                    workshop focused specifically on DreamSpace Academy and worked with seven core team
                                    members. We tackled the problem of DreamSpace's visibility in the local community
                                    and arrived at the Single Question: What if...we train youth ambassadors by solving
                                    real-world problems in their communities and captured their journey through
                                    authentic videos? We then spent the final day of our workshop to gather photographs
                                    and turned them into an authentic Innovation Story.</p>
