                Building a Safer, More Respectful Digital Sri Lanka
                In today‚Äôs digital world, online hate speech continues to fuel polarization, misinformation, and
                violence ‚Äî especially in multilingual and culturally diverse contexts like Sri Lanka. Recognizing
                this urgent challenge, DreamSpace Academy has developed a first-of-its-kind AI-powered tool and
                chatbot designed to detect, monitor, and constructively respond to hate speech across Tamil,
                Sinhala, and English online content.
            </p>

            <h5 class="template-margin-top-3">What We‚Äôve Built</h5>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                Our tool goes beyond traditional hate speech detection. It‚Äôs an AI-powered system trained on local
                linguistic patterns, regional slangs, and culturally nuanced content. Unlike most global solutions, ours
                is built for Sri Lanka ‚Äî by Sri Lankans.
            </p>
            <h6 class="template-margin-top-3">Key Features:</h6>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                ‚óæ Multilingual Detection: Understands hate speech in Tamil, Sinhala, and English, including code-mixed
                and
                transliterated expressions.
            </p>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                ‚óæ Smart Counter-Narratives: Offers constructive, ethical, and de-escalating responses to hate speech
                through a chatbot or browser extension.
            </p>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">

            <h5 class="template-margin-top-3">What We‚Äôve Done So Far</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>‚óæ Collected and labeled over 50,000 data points (hate and non-hate content) across digital
                    platforms.
                </li>
                <li>‚óæ Developed and piloted a working prototype, tested with real content from social media, news
                    websites, and YouTube.</li>
                <li>‚óæ Designed a chatbot and browser extension prototype that assists users in identifying hate and
                    generating positive responses.</li>
                <li>‚óæ Received recognition and support from international partners including IREX and Peace Direct.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="template-margin-top-3">Why It Matters</h5>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                Sri Lankans ‚Äî especially youth ‚Äî want to counter hate speech, but don‚Äôt always know how to respond
                without escalating tension. Our tool helps them do just that ‚Äî ethically, safely, and constructively.
            </p>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                By turning bystanders into active peacebuilders, this innovation aims to shift digital conversations
                from toxic to transformative.
