            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                Sri Lanka's digital landscape faces a persistent challenge: online hate speech that amplifies social divisions, spreads misinformation, and can escalate into real-world violence. This problem is particularly complex in our multilingual context, where hate speech often appears in Tamil, Sinhala, English, or code-mixed expressions that global monitoring tools fail to detect or understand.
            </p>

            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                DreamSpace Academy has developed a comprehensive AI-powered solution specifically designed for Sri Lankan digital environments. Our tool goes beyond simple detection to actively support constructive dialogue and peaceful online engagement.
            </p>

            <h5 class="template-margin-top-3">Our Approach</h5>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                Unlike generic hate speech detection systems, our tool is built with deep understanding of Sri Lankan linguistic patterns, cultural contexts, and regional expressions. We've designed a system that not only identifies problematic content but provides pathways for constructive response.
            </p>
            <h6 class="template-margin-top-3">Core Capabilities:</h6>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                ‚óæ <b>Multilingual Detection Engine:</b> Our AI system recognizes hate speech across Tamil, Sinhala, and English content, including transliterated text and code-mixed expressions commonly used in Sri Lankan social media.

            </p>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                ‚óæ <b>Counter-Narrative Generation:</b> The system suggests constructive, de-escalating responses to hate speech, helping users engage positively rather than amplifying conflict.


            </p>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                ‚óæ <b>Human-Validated Accuracy:</b> We combine AI efficiency with human oversight to ensure cultural sensitivity and contextual appropriateness in all responses.


            </p>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                ‚óæ <b>Real-Time Browser Integration:</b> Our upcoming browser extension identifies potential hate content as users browse and offers guidance on constructive engagement or reporting mechanisms.
            </p>

            <!-- <h5 class="template-margin-top-3">What We‚Äôve Done So Far</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>‚óæ Collected and labeled over 50,000 data points (hate and non-hate content) across digital
                    platforms.
                </li>
                <li>‚óæ Developed and piloted a working prototype, tested with real content from social media, news
                    websites, and YouTube.</li>
                <li>‚óæ Designed a chatbot and browser extension prototype that assists users in identifying hate and
                    generating positive responses.</li>
                <li>‚óæ Received recognition and support from international partners including IREX and Peace Direct.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="template-margin-top-3">Why It Matters</h5>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                Sri Lankans ‚Äî especially youth ‚Äî want to counter hate speech, but don‚Äôt always know how to respond
                without escalating tension. Our tool helps them do just that ‚Äî ethically, safely, and constructively.
            </p>
            <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                By turning bystanders into active peacebuilders, this innovation aims to shift digital conversations
                from toxic to transformative.
            </p>

                <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                    Over the past year, we have systematically built this capability from the ground up. Our team collected and annotated over 50,000 data points spanning hate and non-hate content across major digital platforms. This dataset forms the foundation for training our AI models to understand the nuanced ways hate speech manifests in Sri Lankan online spaces.
                </p>

                <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                    We've developed and tested LLM powered prototypes that work across social media platforms, news websites, and video content. Our upcoming chatbot and browser extension have undergone initial testing with real user scenarios, demonstrating the practical value of AI-assisted counter-narrative generation.

                <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                    Our research addresses a critical gap in digital literacy and online engagement. Many Sri Lankans, particularly young people, want to counter hate speech but lack effective strategies for responding without escalating tensions. Our tool provides them with evidence-based, constructive alternatives.

                <p class="template-padding-reset" align="justify">
                    By transforming passive observers into informed digital citizens, this technology can shift the tenor of online discourse from divisive to constructive. Rather than simply removing harmful content, we're building capacity for positive engagement.
