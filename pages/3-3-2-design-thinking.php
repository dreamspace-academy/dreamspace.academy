        <b style="color: #56509F">Expertise</b>
        <p>Maite is partner at The Morph Company, a Berlin-based consultancy for Innovation and
Transformation. Her core experience is in impact-driven tech entrepreneurship, Design Thinking and
agile product development.</br>While working in Europe, Canada, Cuba, Maite has experienced innovation approaches in different
regions of the world. Today she helps organisations, their leaders and teams to establish authentic
relationships with their users and to innovate with purpose in our rapid changing digital age.</p>

        <b style="color: #56509F">Workshop</b>
        <p>Maite gave a five-days Design Thinking training to 16 members of the core team of the DreamSpace
Academy. In this workshop, the team worked on designing user-centric solution ideas to specific
challenges related to the DreamSpace Academy. The training consisted of a combination of
theoretical inputs and hands-on team work. The participants applied different methods and tools for
qualitative user research, creative ideation, prototyping, testing and iteration of their solution ideas.</p>

        <b style="color: #56509F">Impact</b>
        <p>After framing and redefining the initial problems, the teams specifically worked on the strategic
challenges of “How to gain trust from the parents of young boys and girls in Batticaloa for innovative
and non-conventional projects of DreamSpace”? and “How to create meaningful partnerships with
schools and other relevant institutions in Batticaloa?”</br>Besides developing concrete ideas for the application in future projects of the DreamSpace
Academy, this training also allowed the team to sharpen its ability to develop innovative ideas and
learn how to pass this spirit on to other members of the organization. The team also reflected
around the attitudes, values and principles associated with user-centered design.</p>

      <p>
        The DreamSpace Academy has a brilliant approach to empower local youth, to activate and
encourage them to solve the challenges of their communities. I believe that they are carrying out an
extremely important mission for Eastern Sri Lanka.</br>It was very impressive to see the team’s dedication and how they dream and work for a better
future!
