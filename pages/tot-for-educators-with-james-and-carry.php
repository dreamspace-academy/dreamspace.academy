               <p>DreamSpace Academy Batticaloa organized the Teaching Technology And Design workshop with Carrie Leung and Benjamin James Simpson, who are Trainers in STEAMHEAD</p>

               <b style="color: #56509F">Workshop Info</b>
               <p>The workshop focused on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Critical Thinking into Teaching Protocols, with the aim of fostering progressive education and student-centered classrooms. Participants were introduced to a variety of innovative teaching protocols, including the Reflection Prompts, Gallery Walk Feedback, Menti Meter Crowdsourcing, and several other essential protocols. These protocols were designed to enhance student motivation, empower students to take an active role in their learning, create memorable educational experiences, and enable intentional teaching and curriculum design During the workshop, the participant not only learned these teaching protocols but also showcased their practical application and proposed ways to incorporate these protocols into their existing curriculum and classroom settings.

               <b style="color: #56509F">Impact</b>
               <p>The workshop was held on April 10th, 2023. Our workshops have created a significant ripple effect in the local education community. During the training, teachers from Batticaloa schools and trainers from DreamSpace Academy received specialized instruction. Following the workshop, DreamSpace Academy trainers began leading interactive workshops for students and conducting Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions for school teachers.
               <br><br>
               This initiative has successfully reached more than 20 schools, fostering a collaborative learning environment and enhancing teaching practices. Due to the positive outcomes, teachers, schools, and the zonal education department have requested us to continue delivering TOT sessions across more institutions. Our trainers are actively providing ongoing workshops for teachers
